Tian et al. (2012) proposed an "augmented" version of the modified covariates
method that explicitly account for the variation due to the main effects of the
biomarkers. When the outcome is continuous, it is equivalent to fitting a
(penalized) multivariate linear regression with biomarker and
treatment-biomarker interaction terms. Again, biomarkers are classified as
predictive when their estimated treatment-biomarker coefficients are non-zero.

Estimating Interactions Between a Treatment and a Large Number of Covariates"
