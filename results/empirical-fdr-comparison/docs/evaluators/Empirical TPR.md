The empirical true positive rate (TPR) is the mean of the true positive
proportions (TPP) stratified over each data-generating process and sample size.
For any given simulated dataset, the TPP is computed as
\begin{equation}
  \text{TPP} = \frac{\text{# of predictive biomarkers classified as predictive}}
  {\text{# of predictive biomarkers}}.
\end{equation}
