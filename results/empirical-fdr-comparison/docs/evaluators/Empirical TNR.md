The empirical true negative rate (TNR) is the mean of the true negative
proportions (TNP) stratified over each data-generating process and sample size.
For any given simulated dataset, the TNP is computed as
\begin{equation}
  \text{TNP} = \frac{\text{# of non-predictive biomarkers not classified as predictive}}
  {\text{# of non-predictive biomarkers}}.
\end{equation}
